### Analysis of Neighborhood Venues using Clustering with python

**Analyzed Walt Disney World Resort hotel locations to determine if new quick service restaurant locations are needed.**

#### [Analysis](https://github.com/Gia12345/Journey-Projects/tree/master/Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects/IBM%20Data%20Science%20Certificate%20Capstone%20Project)

#### [Report](https://github.com/Gia12345/Journey-Projects/blob/master/Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects/IBM%20Data%20Science%20Certificate%20Capstone%20Project/WDW%20Restaurant%20Locations%20Report%20Rev.pdf)

#### Data
1.  The resort area in which the hotel is located is scraped from this web site, and this will be the master list of resort hotels.  This master list included two non-Disney owned resort hotels because they are grouped with Disney resort hotels in the same area.  (https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/hotels).
2.  Longitude and latitude information for the resort hotels is required.  Using the resort hotel address from this website (https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/hotels/addresses), longitude and latitude are retrieved from TomTom API.
3.  The number of rooms for each resort hotel is retrieved from this web site (https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/hotels/number-rooms).
4.  The number and types of venues near the resort hotel, which is accessed using Foursquare API, is used.


#### Skills
- All data was scraped from websites.
- Python libraries used include sklearn, geopy, numpy, pandas, BeautifulSoup (web scraping), and fuzzywuzzy.
- Used Jupyter notebook.

### [Analysis of Loan Interest Rates using Linear Regression with python](https://github.com/Gia12345/Journey-Projects/tree/master/Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects/Loan%20Interest%20Rate%20Analysis)

Analyzed data from loans to predict loan interest rates.

#### Data 
- From csv file (see [sample](https://github.com/Gia12345/Journey-Projects/blob/master/Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects/Loan%20Interest%20Rate%20Analysis/data/loan_interest_rates_slice.csv))
- 400,000 records
- 26 features

#### Skills

- Python libraries used include sklearn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
- Used Jupyter notebook.
- [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/gia.g#!/vizhome/LoanInterestRateAnalysis/JobIR)

### [Analysis of Anonymous Data using Logistic Regression and K Neighbors Classifier with python](https://github.com/Gia12345/Journey-Projects/tree/master/Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects/Anonymous%20Data%20Analysis)

Analyzed anonymous data to classify data into one of two categores.  Created, trained, saved, and retrieved models to use on test data.  Results required were the probability that the record was classfied as 1 (vs 0).

#### Data 
- From two csv files (see [sample](https://github.com/Gia12345/Journey-Projects/blob/master/Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects/Anonymous%20Data%20Analysis/data/exercise_02_trainslice_2.csv)), one for training data and one for test data
- 40,000 records in training set
- 10,000 records in test set
- 100 features

#### Skills

- Python libraries used include sklearn, numpy, and pandas.
- Created and used a personal library.
- Used Spyder editor.
