### Analysis of Covid19 and Texas Counties Using Regression with Python 
#### (Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net, Support Vector Regressor, Decision Tree Regressor and Random Forest Regressor)

Worked on a team in the Machine Learning for Social Good Hackathon to predict outcomes of Covid19 in Texas counties and developed solution using AWS Amazon Sagemaker.

- #### Report
    [Presentation](https://github.com/Gia12345/Social-Good-Hackathon/blob/master/Data_Liberation_pres_final.pdf)
   
- #### Data
    - Features were gathered from various web sites on 254 counties (records).
    - Features included demographic data such as population, income, home values, health, facilities (airports, hospitals, nursing homes, military), voting records, and land use.
    - From web sites, 23 data sets were downloaded or created with a total of 123 features.
    - [See csv, excel, and txt files.](https://github.com/Gia12345/Social-Good-Hackathon/tree/master/data)

- #### Skills
    - Python libraries used include sklearn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
    - Used Jupyter notebook.
    - Loaded data into AWS S3.
    - Utilized AWS Amazon Sagemaker to run Jupyter Notebooks.
    
### Analysis of Neighborhood Venues Using Clustering With Python

Analyzed Walt Disney World Resort hotel locations to determine if new quick service restaurant locations are needed.

- #### Analysis
    [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/Gia12345/Journey-Projects/tree/master/Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects/IBM%20Data%20Science%20Certificate%20Capstone%20Project/WDW%20Restaurant%20Locations/Analysis)

- #### Report
    [Summary of Analysis with Visualizations](https://github.com/Gia12345/Journey-Projects/blob/master/Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects/IBM%20Data%20Science%20Certificate%20Capstone%20Project/WDW%20Restaurant%20Locations/WDW%20Restaurant%20Locations%20Report%20Rev%20(2).pdf)

- #### Data
    1.  The resort area in which the hotel is located is scraped from this web site, and this will be the master list of resort hotels.  This master list included two non-Disney owned resort hotels because they are grouped with Disney resort hotels in the same area.  (https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/hotels).
    2.  Longitude and latitude information for the resort hotels is required.  Using the resort hotel address from this website (https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/hotels/addresses), longitude and latitude are retrieved from TomTom API.
    3.  The number of rooms for each resort hotel is retrieved from this web site (https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/hotels/number-rooms).
    4.  The number and types of venues near the resort hotel, which is accessed using Foursquare API, is used.


- #### Skills
    - All data was scraped from websites.
    - Python libraries used include sklearn, geopy, numpy, pandas, BeautifulSoup (web scraping), and fuzzywuzzy.
    - Used Jupyter notebook.

### Analysis of Anonymous Data Using Classification With Python (Logistic Regression and K Neighbors Classifier) 

Analyzed anonymous data to classify data into one of two categores.  Created, trained, saved, and retrieved models to use on test data.  Results required were the probability that the record was classfied as 1 (vs 0).

- #### Analysis
    [Python files](https://github.com/Gia12345/Journey-Projects/tree/master/Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects/Anonymous%20Data%20Analysis)
