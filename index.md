### [Analysis of Neighborhood Venues using Clustering with python](https://github.com/Gia12345/Journey-Projects/tree/master/Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects/IBM%20Data%20Science%20Certificate%20Capstone%20Project)

Analyzed Walt Disney World Resort hotel locations to determine if new quick service restaurant locations are needed.

- [Report](https://github.com/Gia12345/Journey-Projects/blob/master/Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects/IBM%20Data%20Science%20Certificate%20Capstone%20Project/WDW%20Restaurant%20Locations%20Report%20Rev.pdf)

Data from the following sources
1.  The resort area in which the hotel is located is scraped from this web site, and this will be the master list of resort hotels.  This master list included two non-Disney owned resort hotels because they are grouped with Disney resort hotels in the same area.  (https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/hotels).
2.  Longitude and latitude information for the resort hotels is required.  This information is retrieved using the resort hotel address from this website (https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/hotels/addresses) and TomTom.
3.  The number of rooms for each resort hotel is retrieved from this web site (https://touringplans.com/walt-disney-world/hotels/number-rooms).
4.  The number and types of venues near the resort hotel, which is accessed using Foursquare location data, is used.


Skills
- All data was gathered from websites.
- Python libraries used include sklearn, geopy, numpy, pandas, BeautifulSoup (web scraping), and fuzzywuzzy.
- Used Jupyter notebook.

### [Analysis of Loan Interest Rates using Linear Regression with python](https://github.com/Gia12345/Journey-Projects/tree/master/Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects/Loan%20Interest%20Rate%20Analysis)

Analyzed data from loans to predict loan interest rates.

Data from csv file (see [sample](https://github.com/Gia12345/Journey-Projects/blob/master/Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects/Loan%20Interest%20Rate%20Analysis/data/loan_interest_rates_slice.csv))

Skills

- Analyzed 400,000 records with 26 features.
- Python libraries used include sklearn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
- Used Jupyter notebook.
- [Tableau](https://public.tableau.com/profile/gia.g#!/vizhome/LoanInterestRateAnalysis/JobIR)

### [Analysis of Anonymous Data using Logistic Regression and K Neighbors Classifier with python](https://github.com/Gia12345/Journey-Projects/tree/master/Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects/Anonymous%20Data%20Analysis)

Analyzed anonymous data to classify data into one of two categores.  Created, trained, saved, and retrieved model to use on test data.  Results required were the probability that the record was classfied as 1 (vs 0).

Data from csv file (see [sample](https://github.com/Gia12345/Journey-Projects/blob/master/Data-Science-Data-Analysis-Projects/Anonymous%20Data%20Analysis/data/exercise_02_trainslice_2.csv))

Skills

- Analyzed 40,000 records in the training set and 10,000 records in the test set.
- Records included 100 features.
- Python libraries used include sklearn, numpy, and pandas.
- Created and used a personal library.
- Used Spyder editor.
